POLYNOMIAL ADDER
This program adds two polynomials and displays the result.

Enter first polynomial.
Enter each term on a separate line; coefficient followed by power.
For example, 3 4 represents the term 3x^4.
Enter -1 -1 to end input for the polynomial.
4 5
7 -4
Error: cannot have negative power.
Please re-enter term and continue.
7 4
-1 2
9 0
-1 -1
First polynomial: 4x^5 + 7x^4 - x^2 + 9

Enter second polynomial.
Enter each term on a separate line; coefficient followed by power.
For example, 3 4 represents the term 3x^4.
Enter -1 -1 to end input for the polynomial.
2 4
3 1
-10 0
-1 -1
Second polynomial: 2x^4 + 3x - 10

First polynomial:   4x^5 + 7x^4 - x^2 + 9
Second polynomial:  2x^4 + 3x - 10
Sum:                4x^5 + 9x^4 - x^2 + 3x - 1
